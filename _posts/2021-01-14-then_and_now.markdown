10 months ago I decided to jump head first into what I hoped would be the start of a new career and the chance to change my life. 10 months ago I applied to Flatiron School to study Software Engineering. 10 months ago I knew next to nothing about writing code, well scratch that, I knew nothing about coding. I had no idea that it would be one of the more challenging things that I have done in my life and one of the most rewarding things that I have done. I decided to study software development one night while I was talking on the phone with one of my sisters. In my mind a job as a software developer was a better option than the job that I currently hold. The subsequent 10 months after making the jump have changed my life.

It is still pretty crazy for me to think that at the beginning of last year even the basics of creating a web app would have been the most foreign thing to me. If I tried to listen to someone talk about their experience coding, all of the terminology and lingo would have gone straight over my head. Now here I am in January of 2021 and I am getting ready to finish my fifth project at Flatiron School. Those same concepts that would have befuddled me are now very familiar. It is an amazing thing to know that I can create a web app, that I can create a solution to my own or someone else’s problem.

Learning how to code has changed the way that I think about things. Example: I was at work one night and someone told a riddle that dealt with numbers. I gave what I thought was a logical answer to the riddle. I was wrong but in my head I started to argue that “well if I was coding this riddle out...” I don’t remember the particulars very well but the point being that my thoughts jumped to coding. I hear “array” used in a sentence I think of square brackets and a list. Curly Braces… I always used to call them squiggly brackets.

I talk to my mom a lot on the telephone and she will ask about how a project is going or my school work is. I will take that opportunity to launch into a rant about what problem I am trying to solve or something cool that I learned that day. She will just sit and listen and when I am done she will tell me that she has no idea what I just said. It is funny to think that 10 months ago that would have been me. As graduation draws closer and the beginning of a job search draws near I can’t help but to be grateful. I am grateful that I made the decision to take this leap into the world of software development. I am grateful for Flatiron School. I am grateful for Dominique my cohort lead for all of her instruction. I am grateful that a whole new world of opportunity has been opened to me.


I CAN’T WAIT TO SEE WHAT’S NEXT….
