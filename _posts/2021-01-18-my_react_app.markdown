My final project for Flatiron is an app to get information about movies and the actors in those movies. This project was done using the React framework and a Rails backend used as an API. This project certainly had it’s challenges for me, but as with other projects during my time learning at Flatiron, doing this project really helped me to understand React and how information flows. I used “The Movie Database” API for this project.

My React app is as previously stated an app to find information on movies.  One of the issues I had was getting a show page up for a single movie. This issue took about 3 days for me to finally get solved. I already knew that I would need a container component and a stateless component to achieve this and I knew the list of how the information was going to flow between these two components. One problem was that I was in my own head about how to start structuring my container component. Do I connect to the store using redux and make use of the global state or do I have local state? I ran this question through my head so much and when I started coding it out one way I would run into an issue and then try another approach. Eventually I just deleted my files and started over after taking a step back from the work and taking a breather. When the code started to fall into place and my page started rendering the information that I needed displayed, so many of the questions that I had about certain nuances of the flow of information in React started to get answered.

This was very challenging for me but this was also very very fun and I am looking forward to continue work in this project to add the functionality that I ultimately want. I am really looking forward to having “A Place For Nerds” be fully flushed out and I am looking forward to the challenges and all the new things I will learn about software development.
